                <h1>Call for Papers and Themes</h1>
                <h2>(DE)COLONIALITY AND DIVERSITY IN HISTORIES OF EDUCATION</h2>
                <div class="col-50">
                    <p>45 ISCHE presents as a thematic proposal the problematization of the persistence
                        of oppressive and subalternizing educational processes, over a long historical
                        period and at a global level, associated with resistance movements and struggles
                        for other educations. It invites historians of education to discuss the
                        multiple histories of education constituted in the processes of historical elaboration
                        of social, cultural and educational geopolitics. It encourages researchers to
                        investigate the (de)coloniality and diversity of the histories of education, through
                        studies that discuss the organizing relational dynamics of societies that
                        authorize oppressive universalism. Despite technological advances and scientific
                        news, in recent decades we have experienced the advancement of social inequalities,
                        school inequalities, precarious work, the resurgence of religious intolerance, racism
                        and violent practices against women, indigenous peoples and LGBTQIAPN+
                        groups , associated with the voracity of markets, which everywhere continue, as in
                        previous centuries, destroying nature, stealing lives and interrupting stories. By proposing the
                        discussion of (de)coloniality and diversity in educational
                        histories, the organizers of 45 ISCHE invite researchers to question
                        the multiple processes of production and transmission of various knowledge,
                        arising from experiences constituted in different geographies. It suggests
                        discussions that can encourage questioning about the recipients of educational
                        policies and reforms, about the training of teachers, as well as the social agencies
                        that enabled the participation of subordinate and marginalized groups in the
                        educational debate, in the face of the imposition of an education/ single reason. </p>

                        May 10, 2024
                        To better organize the theme proposed for ISCHE 45, we suggest the following 6
                        axes.
                        June 20, 2024
                        Last day to Register at Early Registration Rates
                        unique and universalized, we propose that researchers advance in historical
                        research on ethnic-racial relations, gender, generation and social class relations,
                        in order to favor the discussion of intersectionality and reflect on the historical
                        role of education in favoring inequalities and oppression.
                        <br>
                        We invite historians of education to question the epistemological, ontological
                        and cultural diversity that organizes societies and to reflect on the dynamics of
                        the historical constitution of school cultures: times and spaces, teaching methods,
                        uniforms, books and school materials . In this debate, we suggest deconstructing
                        the idea of cultural diversity based on globalized localisms, produced by hegemonic
                        nations, and demonstrating, through historical research, the problem of the
                        universalization of a single school, given the multiple conceptions of being in
                        the world. In other words, decolonize the center and periphery relations, produced
                        historically, discuss the geopolitics of education and ask about the educational
                        and schooling dynamics at the origin of epistemological and cultural
                        domination. XXXXX on axes 5 and 6.
